Simple encryption app with the best UI on the market. A random key is chosen between 1 and 95 to increase the ascii value of each character and the key is stored in hexadecimal at the end and beginning of the encrypted message (key: 10 -> 0A -> 0messageA). Works only for ascii characters between 32 and 126 (Latin alphabet letters, numbers and symbols).
